            <h3>Method</h3>
            <p>The method developed by MPSSP is based on a SVM model that utilizes the results of PSI-BLAST searches on the proteinâ€™s sequence. SVM is a supervised machine learning technology with statistical learning theory foundations. Based on the combina-tion of SVM and PSI-BLAST, we have optimized the prediction accuracy of b-sheets,from a given sequence dataset, by experi-menting on different kernels and different optimization processes.</p>

            <h3>Management Scripts</h3>
            <p>Using the Makefile, you can easily setup your development environment with a few simple commands. With the power of flask-script you can create your own commands with the flask app context setup for you.</p>
